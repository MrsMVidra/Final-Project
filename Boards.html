    <p>
        1. Articulate the complexities of network and application infrastructure and apply critical thinking skills to how they affect
        technology forensics investigations and incident response procedures.
    <br>
    <br>
        2. Identify and apply in a forensics context the various topologies, standards, technologies and protocols employed in
        computer systems, including file system formats and their attributes.
    <br>
    <br>
        3. Evaluate, select and deploy computer forensic measures for the response, mitigation and analysis of a security incident
         pertaining to digital artifacts and how information was compromised.
    <br>
    <br>
         4. Analyze and evaluate the current investigative and legal aspects of information and computer forensics, including
         electronic discovery, depositions, litigation and corporate personnel processes.
    <br>
    <br>
        5. Evaluate and execute the strategies, methodologies, techniques and state-of-the-art forensics tools for the preservation of
        digital evidence on computer systems, network systems and other electronic devices.
    <br>
    <br>
        6. Create tracking processes to follow the trail of electronic evidence through digital systems, including documentation,
        formal reporting and presentation.
